### Backend Setup
1. Initialized a Node.js project in the `backend` folder.
2. Installed required dependencies:
   - Core: `express`, `mongoose`, `dotenv`, `cors`, `jsonwebtoken`, `bcryptjs`
   - Development: `nodemon`, `morgan`
3. Created a `.gitignore` file to exclude `node_modules` and `.env`.
4. Created a `server.js` file to configure the Express server.

### Frontend Setup
1. Set up a React.js project in the `frontend` folder.
2. Installed necessary packages: `react`, `react-dom`, `react-scripts`.
3. Created a `.gitignore` file to exclude `node_modules`.

## Next Steps
- Continue developing the backend and frontend features as outlined in the project objectives.
